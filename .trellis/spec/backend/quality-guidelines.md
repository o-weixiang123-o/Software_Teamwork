# Quality Guidelines

> Code quality standards for Go backend services.

---

## Overview

Every backend service must remain independently testable, buildable, and
deployable. Quality checks run from each service directory because every service
owns a separate `go.mod`.

Minimum Go service-local checks:

```bash
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/server
```

`services/knowledge-runtime/` is a Python vendored runtime boundary rather than
a Go service. When changing the runtime API, route registration, parser/chunking
configuration, or Docker entrypoints, run targeted runtime tests from
`services/knowledge-runtime` and the owning Knowledge adapter checks:

```bash
cd services/knowledge-runtime
PYTHONPATH=. uv run --no-project --with pytest --with pytest-asyncio python -m pytest <targeted tests> -q

cd ../knowledge
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/adapter
```

### Knowledge Runtime PDF E2E

#### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing Knowledge document upload, runtime API/worker wiring,
  parser/chunking/embedding/indexing behavior, retrieval contracts, or
  host-run Knowledge runtime startup.
- Applies to `services/knowledge`, `services/knowledge-runtime`, `deploy/**`,
  and Knowledge runbook entries.

#### 2. Signatures

```bash
# Exact command may vary by local runtime profile, but the smoke must prove:
# upload PDF -> runtime parse/chunk/embed/index -> retrieval returns hits.
DL_T_673-1999.pdf
```

#### 3. Contracts

- The old standalone `services/parser` must not be restored.
- Knowledge owns document business state, permissions, and public responses.
- `services/knowledge-runtime` owns parse, chunk, embedding, index, and
  retrieval support as an implementation detail behind the Knowledge adapter.
- A real PDF E2E must record document readiness, chunk count, query id, hit
  count, and a short retrieval preview when the fixture is available.

#### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime API unreachable | Fail with the configured `VENDOR_RUNTIME_URL` and sanitized proxy/network diagnostics. |
| Worker not consuming tasks | Fail with document status, elapsed polling time, and worker health/log pointer. |
| Chunk count is zero | Fail with document id, parser configuration, and runtime task status. |
| Retrieval returns zero hits for the fixture | Fail with query id, chunk count, and retrieval config. |

#### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: targeted unit/contract tests pass and a real PDF E2E proves upload,
  parse, chunk, index, and retrieval.
- Base: PR records that only unit/contract checks ran because local runtime
  infrastructure is unavailable, with the blocker stated explicitly.
- Bad: reporting success from adapter unit tests while the real runtime upload
  or retrieval path was not exercised.

#### 6. Tests Required

- Knowledge adapter: `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/adapter`.
- Runtime route/config tests for changed Python surfaces.
- Docker policy and Compose config checks when deployment wiring changes.
- Real PDF E2E when `DL_T_673-1999.pdf` is present.

#### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```bash
go test ./...  # then claim PDF parsing and retrieval were proven
```

Correct:

```bash
go test ./...
# plus an explicit PDF upload -> ready/chunks -> retrieval smoke against runtime
```

When lint tooling is introduced, CI should run the selected linter for each
changed service.

## Go Service CI Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing repository CI for landed Go services under `services/*`.

### 2. Signatures

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/go-services.yml`.
- Events: `pull_request` and `push` to `develop` with path filters for `services/**` and the workflow file.
- Matrix key: `service`, with one entry for each landed Go service that owns a `go.mod`.

### 3. Contracts

- Toolchain: `actions/setup-go@v5` with `go-version: '1.25.x'`.
- Working directory: `services/${{ matrix.service }}`.
- Required commands for every matrix service: `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/server`.
- QA contract: run `go build ./cmd/agent` when `services/qa/cmd/agent` exists.
- Cache dependency input must exist for every matrix service; use `services/${{ matrix.service }}/go.mod` unless all services have `go.sum`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Service directory has `go.mod` but no matrix entry | Add it before merging CI changes. |
| Matrix entry has no `services/<name>/go.mod` | Remove or fix the entry; setup/run will fail. |
| Go service module diverges from `go-version: '1.25.x'` CI baseline | Update the module baseline or CI baseline together. |
| `services/qa/cmd/agent` exists but CI does not build it | Add or restore the QA agent build step. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `services/qa` runs tests, server build, and agent build under Go `1.25.x`.
- Base: a service with no `go.sum` still caches against its existing `go.mod`.
- Bad: a root-level Go workflow runs from the repository root and assumes a root `go.mod`.

### 6. Tests Required

- For each changed Go service, run `go test ./...` from the service directory.
- For each changed Go service, run `go build ./cmd/server` from the service directory.
- For QA, also run `go build ./cmd/agent` from `services/qa`.
- Run `git diff --check` before commit.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```yaml
with:
  go-version: '1.25.x'
  cache-dependency-path: services/${{ matrix.service }}/go.sum
```

Correct when not every service has `go.sum`:

```yaml
with:
  go-version: '1.25.x'
  cache-dependency-path: services/${{ matrix.service }}/go.mod
```

---

## Go Migration CI Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing repository CI for service-owned PostgreSQL migrations under `services/*/migrations`.

### 2. Signatures

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/go-migrations.yml`.
- Events: `pull_request` and `push` to `develop` with path filters for service migrations, service README files, the workflow file, and technology decisions.
- Matrix key: `service`, with one entry for each landed Go service that owns SQL migration files.

### 3. Contracts

- PostgreSQL CI image: `postgres:16-alpine`.
- Goose command: `go run github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@v3.27.1 -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up`.
- Working directory: `services/${{ matrix.service }}`.
- Migration filenames must match ordered snake_case names such as `0001_create_users.sql`.
- SQL migrations must include `-- +goose Up`; `-- +goose Down` is optional only for forward-only slices.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Service has `migrations/*.sql` but no matrix entry | Add the service to migration CI before merging. |
| SQL migration has no `-- +goose Up` annotation | Add the annotation so goose can parse it. |
| Migration filename lacks an ordered prefix | Rename to `0001_<snake_case_summary>.sql` or the next ordered prefix. |
| README goose command version differs from CI | Update both to `v3.27.1`. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `services/auth` migration applies against an empty PostgreSQL database with `goose@v3.27.1`.
- Base: a forward-only migration has `-- +goose Up` and no down section.
- Bad: a service relies only on PostgreSQL Docker init scripts, or README says `goose` without a pinned version.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run migration apply validation for every matrix service or rely on the PR workflow when local PostgreSQL is unavailable.
- Run `git diff --check` before commit.
- Run service-local Go tests when migration files or repository code changed.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```bash
goose -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up
```

Correct:

```bash
go run github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@v3.27.1 -dir migrations postgres "$DATABASE_URL" up
```

---

## Scenario: Local Integration Compose Baseline

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, local demo seed data,
  infrastructure image tags, Docker image source overlays, service ports,
  readiness wiring, service tokens, or `.env.example` files for the backend
  integration environment.
- Applies to `deploy/**`, host-run migration wiring, local seed docs, Docker
  policy/environment scripts, and documentation that tells frontend or new
  contributors how to start services.

### 2. Signatures

- Compose entrypoint:
  - `CONFIG_SECRET_FILE=.env.example ./scripts/config/load-profile.sh --print-compose-env`
  - `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .local/config/dev.env config --quiet`
  - `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml --env-file .local/config/dev.env config --services`
- Runtime entrypoint:
  - `cp .env.example .env.local`
  - `./scripts/local/dev-up.sh`
  - `./scripts/local/run-backend.sh`
  - `cd apps/web && bun install && bun run dev`
- Default Compose services:
  - `postgres`
  - `redis`
  - `minio`
  - `minio-init`
  - `elasticsearch`
- Public browser/API entrypoint after host-run services start:
  - `http://localhost:8080` through gateway.
- Operational routes:
  - `GET /healthz`
  - `GET /readyz`

### 3. Contracts

- The root local Compose path stays infrastructure-only. Business services and
  the Knowledge runtime API/worker run on the host. Local Elasticsearch is part
  of the default Compose infrastructure for Knowledge runtime doc-engine
  support.
- Docs must provide host-run commands for Auth, File, Knowledge, AI Gateway,
  QA, Document, Gateway, and frontend.
- Frontend and browser-facing documentation must route traffic through gateway;
  internal service ports may be exposed only for local debugging.
- `config/` is the single default local configuration source for committed
  non-sensitive defaults and profile overrides. Root `.env.example` is the
  local secret template; `.env.local` is untracked local input.
- `.env.example` values must be local placeholders and must not contain real
  provider keys, tokens, passwords, or production credentials.
- Startup scripts must use `config/ctl` through `scripts/config/load-profile.sh`
  to render `.local/config/<profile>.env` and `.env.sh`; they must not source
  `deploy/.env` as the authoritative default or duplicate service env defaults.
- Knowledge runtime worker timeout decorators must stay active in the default
  host-run profile with `ENABLE_TIMEOUT_ASSERTION=1` in `config/base.yaml`.
  Do not remove this default unless the worker timeout mechanism is replaced
  and the runbook documents the accepted risk or replacement behavior.
- `run-backend.sh` must not prepare or start the retired standalone Parser.
  Knowledge parsing runs through the Knowledge runtime API/worker path.
- Host-run uv package downloads should use `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` from
  `config/base.yaml`, with official PyPI as the committed default. Mainland
  China mirror usage must be explicit, preferably through `dev-up.sh --china`
  which prepares Knowledge runtime dependencies/artifacts, or through local
  untracked env overrides. `ragflow_deps/download_deps.py --china` remains the
  manual fallback when runtime dependency preparation was intentionally skipped.
  This is separate from Docker registry rewrite and should not be handled in
  Docker policy.
- Runtime Python dependency changes belong under `services/knowledge-runtime`;
  the default local backend startup path must not depend on `services/parser`.
- `run-knowledge-parse-stack.sh` must not run direct `docker build` or
  `docker run` for Elasticsearch. Local Elasticsearch lifecycle belongs to the
  default root Compose infrastructure started by `dev-up.sh`.
- `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` must not be active in committed defaults
  or forced by runtime scripts in official-default mode. Mainland China runtime
  model download mirrors are explicit through
  `run-knowledge-parse-stack.sh --china` or local untracked env overrides.
- Host-run Go module downloads should use `GOPROXY` and `GOSUMDB` from
  `config/base.yaml`, with official upstream values as the committed
  default. Mainland China mirror usage must be explicit through
  `dev-up.sh --china`, `run-backend.sh --china`, or local untracked env
  overrides. This covers `dev-up.sh` goose migrations and `run-backend.sh` Go
  service startups; it is separate from Docker registry rewrite and Knowledge
  runtime `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX`.
- `dev-up.sh` should check effective Go module settings before host-run goose
  migrations, and `run-backend.sh` should preflight Go module downloads with
  `go mod download` for each host-run Go service before forking background
  processes. If `--china` is passed, scripts may use mainland China mirrors for
  the current process without rewriting `config/` or `.env.local`. If `.env.local`
  contains mirror values while `--china` was not passed, scripts should
  warn but respect the user's local config. If module download still fails, the
  script must fail in the terminal with the current effective values and
  remediation hints instead of only writing `go run` errors to
  `.local/logs/*.log`.
- Host-run backend processes should be started in managed process groups and
  stopped by process group so `go run` or `uv run` wrapper processes do not
  leave child service binaries listening on local ports.
- Local entrypoint scripts under `scripts/local/` must print clear command-line
  status: starting, per-stage success where useful, warnings, final success,
  final failure with the current stage, and next diagnostic hints. Use
  human-scannable colored status labels when stdout/stderr supports color, with
  `NO_COLOR=1` disabling color. Do not rely on `set -e` alone or force users to
  infer failure from missing output.
- After forking host-run backend services, `run-backend.sh` should watch a short
  configurable startup window and report any process group that exits early with
  the corresponding service log tail. This prevents `backend started` from
  hiding immediate `go run`, dependency download, port binding, or config
  failures.
- `dev-up.sh` must wait for long-running Compose infrastructure health before
  running host migrations or seed SQL. One-shot infrastructure jobs such as
  `minio-init` must run separately and use their own exit code so a normal
  `Exited (0)` does not skip migrations or seed.
- `dev-up.sh` must not initialize retired vector-store collections. Current
  Knowledge ingestion uses Knowledge runtime and its configured doc engine.
- Compose must include practical health checks for infrastructure containers.
- PostgreSQL health checks must probe TCP readiness, e.g.
  `pg_isready -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres`.
- Compose infrastructure images must keep explicit pinned defaults. If a local
  or enterprise registry is required, expose it through image variables such as
  `POSTGRES_IMAGE`, `REDIS_IMAGE`, `MINIO_IMAGE`,
  `MINIO_MC_IMAGE`, and `KNOWLEDGE_RUNTIME_ELASTICSEARCH_IMAGE`; do not replace
  pinned defaults with `latest`.
- For mainland China Docker usage, prefer explicit `dev-up.sh --china`
  registry rewrite or local untracked `*_IMAGE` overrides over daemon mirrors
  and proxies. Do not make third-party registries active defaults in
  committed config. Existing daemon mirrors or proxies are acceptable only
  after `python3 scripts/check_docker_environment.py --profile all --clean-env`
  proves their manifest path is healthy.
- Local Docker image tags must stay pinned and version-aligned across Compose,
  README/runbooks, and `docs/architecture/technology-decisions.md`.
- PostgreSQL seed scripts may create local/demo data only after service-owned
  migrations have applied from the host with `goose@v3.27.1`.
- Local/demo seed changes should have a deterministic contract checker that
  validates required resource IDs, idempotency markers, documentation coverage,
  host-run migration/seed commands, and forbidden secret/private-content
  patterns.
- File Service runs with PostgreSQL metadata in the local baseline, so it must
  receive `FILE_INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` or `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`. Callers that
  may reach File Service without passing through gateway must send a matching
  `X-Service-Token`.
- AI Gateway runs on the host. It may still report provider readiness as degraded
  while seeded placeholder credentials are present; use `/healthz` for process
  startup and `/readyz` only for real provider readiness.
- Seeded local AI Gateway model profiles must use a host-resolvable base URL,
  currently `http://localhost:11434/v1`; do not use container-only names such as
  `host.docker.internal` in the host-run default path.
- Optional real-provider local AI Gateway bootstrap is controlled only by
  `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_SEED_ENABLED=true` plus `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_PROVIDER`,
  `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`, `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_PROVIDER_API_KEY`,
  `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`, `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL`,
  `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_RERANK_MODEL`, and
  `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_RERANK_TOP_N` in untracked `.env.local`. The bootstrap must
  encrypt provider credentials with the same AES-GCM/HMAC contract as
  `services/ai-gateway/internal/service/crypto.go`, update the three default AI
  Gateway profiles, and append/activate a matching QA `llm_config_versions` row
  so QA requests do not keep sending the placeholder chat model.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| Compose YAML or env interpolation is invalid | `docker compose ... config --quiet` must fail before merge. |
| Default Compose service list includes anything other than `postgres`, `redis`, `minio`, `minio-init`, or `elasticsearch` | Remove the service or update policy only if the team explicitly changes the Docker boundary. |
| Host migrations or seed run before PostgreSQL/init scripts are ready | Add or restore an infra health wait in `scripts/local/dev-up.sh`; do not rely on plain `docker compose up -d`. Run one-shot init jobs separately from `up --wait` and fail visibly if they exit non-zero. |
| Knowledge runtime/doc-engine env is configured but required runtime provisioning is missing | Fix the runtime dependency guard, startup docs, or smoke setup; do not restore the old Go adapter Qdrant bootstrap as the default Knowledge path. |
| Compose contains `build:` | Remove it; repository root Compose must stay pull-only infrastructure. |
| Docker policy checker fails | Fix the Compose/docs/script regression or update `scripts/check_docker_policy.py` and the runbook in the same PR when the policy intentionally changes. |
| Retired parser paths or env keys reappear in startup scripts | Remove the parser dependency and route document parsing through `services/knowledge-runtime`. |
| Local startup script exits without a success or failure summary | Add or restore explicit command-line status output in the script and local seed contract checker. |
| Go module preflight, migration, or service startup shows `Get "https://proxy.golang.org/...": i/o timeout` | Confirm `config/base.yaml` contains the repository `GOPROXY` / `GOSUMDB` defaults and `.env.local` has not overridden them unexpectedly. If the mirror is unavailable, override only local `.env.local` or enterprise shell config. The startup script should surface failures in the terminal and exit non-zero. |
| `ENABLE_TIMEOUT_ASSERTION` is missing or disabled in the default local profile | Restore `ENABLE_TIMEOUT_ASSERTION=1` in `config/base.yaml` or document the replacement timeout mechanism and accepted risk in the Knowledge runtime runbook. |
| `stop-backend.sh` only kills the wrapper PID | Start host services in a managed process group and stop the whole group; verify the script does not leave `go run` or `uv run` child services bound to ports. |
| Seeded local AI Gateway profile uses `host.docker.internal` | Replace it with `http://localhost:11434/v1` for the host-run default path. |
| `AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_SEED_ENABLED=true` updates AI Gateway profiles but QA still sends `local-placeholder-chat` | Update the same overlay to append/activate a QA `llm_config_versions` row for `provider='ai-gateway'`, `profile_id='default-chat'`, and `model_name=AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`. |
| Generated provider credential decrypts in SQL but AI Gateway invocation fails with credential decrypt errors | Regenerate credentials with the service crypto contract: `SHA-256(AI_GATEWAY_CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY)` as AES-GCM key and keyed HMAC fingerprint derived from `ai-gateway credential fingerprint v1`; do not invent a bash/OpenSSL-only format. |
| Required Docker image is unavailable locally | Document `docker compose pull <service>` commands and report Docker runtime validation as skipped. |
| Same component appears with multiple Docker tags | Use the documented baseline or record the reason in the implementation document. |
| Compose infrastructure image pull is slow or blocked | Prefer `./scripts/local/dev-up.sh --china`, which applies pinned DaoCloud `*_IMAGE` values for that run, or local untracked `.env.local` overrides; if using daemon mirror, prove it with `scripts/check_docker_environment.py`; use Docker daemon proxy only when registry rewrite and mirror paths are unavailable. |
| File calls return `401 unauthorized` while `file /readyz` is healthy | Verify `FILE_INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` on file and matching `KNOWLEDGE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `DOCUMENT_FILE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, or propagated `X-Service-Token` on callers. |
| Gateway readiness fails | Check Redis and Auth first, then search logs by `X-Request-Id`. |
| Auth/document/ai-gateway readiness fails | Inspect PostgreSQL, host-run migration status, and service logs. |
| Seed data insert fails | Keep scripts idempotent with `ON CONFLICT` and verify migrations ran first. |
| AI Gateway `/readyz` returns placeholder/degraded while `/healthz` is ok | Treat service startup as successful; document that real provider credentials are still required for model calls. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: `deploy/README.md` documents infra pulls, default Compose
  Elasticsearch startup, host-run migrations, host-run services, seed data,
  request-id troubleshooting, and common dependency failures; default Compose
  config parses and lists only the five infra services.
- Base: Docker runtime smoke tests are skipped when images are missing, but the
  exact image pull commands and skipped validation are reported.
- Bad: documentation tells new contributors to run business services through
  Compose, `.env.example` contains a real provider API key, or a seed script
  writes data before the owning service migration has run.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run Compose config parsing for the infra baseline.
- Run `docker compose ... config --services` and confirm only the five default
  infra services are present, including `elasticsearch`.
- Run `bash -n scripts/local/dev-up.sh scripts/local/run-backend.sh scripts/local/stop-backend.sh`
  when local startup scripts change.
- Run `python3 scripts/check_docker_policy.py` and the policy/environment unit
  tests when Compose, Docker docs, image tags, or Docker scripts change.
- Run the local seed contract checker and its unit tests when seed SQL, seed
  docs, startup scripts, Knowledge runtime startup defaults, or host-run Go
  module proxy defaults change.
- For AI Gateway local provider overlay changes, test disabled overlay output,
  enabled overlay SQL redaction/no raw key leakage, missing env validation, and
  `dev-up.sh` piping the generated SQL into `psql`.
- Search Docker and docs for duplicate image tags such as `redis:7` vs
  `redis:7-alpine`, and MinIO server/client tags before declaring version
  cleanup complete.
- Run `git diff --check`.
- Run `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/server` for changed Go services or
  every service referenced by the integration baseline when feasible.
- For QA, also run `go build ./cmd/agent` when `services/qa/cmd/agent` exists.
- Runtime smoke tests should include `docker compose ps`, Gateway `/readyz`, AI
  Gateway `/healthz`, and at least one host `/readyz` call for each host-run core
  service. AI Gateway `/readyz` is a real-provider readiness check and may return
  `503 degraded` for seeded placeholder credentials.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```text
frontend -> http://localhost:8083/internal/v1/knowledge-bases
.env.example -> real provider API key
document worker -> file /internal/v1/files without X-Service-Token
seed SQL -> inserts model_profiles before ai-gateway migrations
AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_* seed -> updates default-chat only; QA active LLM remains local-placeholder-chat
root Compose -> business service or unapproved build entry
```

#### Correct

```text
frontend -> gateway http://localhost:8080/api/v1/knowledge-bases
config/base.yaml + .env.example -> non-sensitive defaults plus local placeholder secrets only
document worker -> file /internal/v1/files with DOCUMENT_FILE_SERVICE_TOKEN
seed SQL -> idempotent local/demo data after host-run service migrations
AI_GATEWAY_LOCAL_* overlay -> updates chat/embedding/rerank profiles and activates matching QA LLM config
root Compose -> postgres, redis, minio, minio-init, elasticsearch only
```

---

## Scenario: Environment-Gated Cross-Service Smoke

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding a smoke test that calls another service or an optional external
  dependency such as AI Gateway, a model provider, object storage, or a parser
  runtime.
- Applies when ordinary unit CI must remain deterministic but operators still
  need an executable proof of the real service client and runtime configuration.

### 2. Signatures

- Name the opt-in gate `<CALLER>_<DEPENDENCY>_SMOKE`; the enabled value is `1`.
- Keep the test beside the real service client and expose one explicit command,
  for example:

```bash
QA_AI_GATEWAY_SMOKE=1 go test ./internal/platform/modelclient \
  -run '^TestAIGatewaySmoke$' -count=1 -v
```

- Reuse the caller's normal endpoint, credential-header, token, profile/model,
  and timeout environment keys instead of inventing parallel smoke-only keys.

### 3. Contracts

- With the gate unset, the test must call `t.Skip` before reading credentials or
  making network requests.
- With the gate enabled, missing required endpoint/profile/token configuration
  must fail with an actionable message that names keys, never values.
- The positive path must use the production service client and assert a minimal
  normalized response.
- Negative probes should stop at the dependency boundary when possible, such as
  invalid service-token or missing-profile checks, to avoid provider cost and
  nondeterministic side effects.
- Missing-resource probes must use a request-scoped unique identifier such as
  `requestID + "-missing-profile"`; do not append a predictable suffix to a
  configured valid resource ID because that name can already exist and reach a
  real provider.
- Generate a request ID for cross-service log correlation. Do not log tokens,
  provider keys, raw downstream bodies, prompts, document text, or vectors.
- Controlled fake providers are preferred. Real providers run only when an
  operator explicitly supplies the gate and credentials.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Smoke gate unset | `SKIP`; ordinary `go test ./...` remains green and offline. |
| Gate set but token/profile/endpoint missing | Fail before network I/O with actionable key names. |
| Dependency authentication rejected | Assert the caller's normalized unauthorized/dependency classification; discard raw body. |
| Selected profile/resource missing | Use a request-scoped missing ID, assert the caller's normalized not-found/dependency classification, and verify a controlled fixture receives no provider call. |
| Provider or dependency unavailable | Fail with request ID and safe configuration hints, not endpoint secrets or provider body. |
| Positive response malformed | Fail on stable normalized fields such as role, finish reason, ID, or result count. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: an opt-in test uses the QA model client, a controlled AI Gateway profile,
  request-ID correlation, positive response assertions, and token/profile
  negative probes whose missing profile ID is scoped to that request.
- Base: a real-provider smoke is documented but skipped until an operator sets
  all required variables.
- Bad: normal CI always calls an external model, a missing-profile probe derives
  `validProfileID + "-missing"`, a test imports another service's `internal`
  packages, or a failure prints raw provider output or a credential.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run the targeted test with the gate unset and assert it reports `SKIP`.
- Exercise the enabled positive and negative paths with a controlled fixture
  before relying on a real provider; assert the missing-resource probe does not
  reach the controlled provider.
- Run the caller service's full unit tests and required builds with the gate
  unset.
- Run `git diff --check` and verify the documented command and link targets.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```go
func TestProviderSmoke(t *testing.T) {
    token := os.Getenv("PROVIDER_API_KEY")
    t.Logf("calling provider with token %s", token)
    missingProfileID := validProfileID + "-missing"
    callProviderDirectly(token)
}
```

#### Correct

```go
func TestAIGatewaySmoke(t *testing.T) {
    if os.Getenv("QA_AI_GATEWAY_SMOKE") != "1" {
        t.Skip("set QA_AI_GATEWAY_SMOKE=1 to run the smoke")
    }
    requestID := newRequestID()
    missingProfileID := requestID + "-missing-profile"
    client := newRuntimeServiceClientFromEnvironment(t)
    result := callWithRequestID(t, client)
    assertNormalizedResult(t, result)
    assertMissingProfileDependencyError(t, client, missingProfileID)
}
```

## Scenario: Gateway Owner Route Smoke

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: adding or changing an env-gated smoke that proves Gateway can
  authenticate through Auth/session cache and proxy a real owner-service route.
- Applies to smoke tests for Gateway public `/api/v1/**` routes whose business
  state is owned by Knowledge, QA, Document, AI Gateway admin routes, or another
  backend owner service.

### 2. Signatures

- Gate name: `GATEWAY_<OWNER>_OWNER_SMOKE=1`, for example
  `GATEWAY_KNOWLEDGE_OWNER_SMOKE=1`.
- Command shape:

```bash
GATEWAY_KNOWLEDGE_OWNER_SMOKE=1 \
GATEWAY_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
<OWNER>_SERVICE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port> \
GATEWAY_SMOKE_USERNAME=admin \
GATEWAY_SMOKE_PASSWORD='local-password' \
go test ./internal/integration -run '^TestGatewayKnowledgeOwnerRouteSmoke$' -count=1 -v
```

- The owner route must be called through Gateway, not by directly calling the
  owner service.

### 3. Contracts

- With the gate unset, the smoke must skip before reading credentials, endpoints,
  or dependency env.
- With the gate enabled, missing env must fail with key names only.
- The smoke must precheck the owner route's required runtime dependencies before
  the Gateway assertion, such as owner service `/readyz`, PostgreSQL, Redis,
  File, Knowledge runtime/doc engine, or AI Gateway depending on route scope.
- The smoke must first call the Gateway route with spoofed `X-User-*` headers
  and no Bearer token, then assert `401 unauthorized`.
- The positive path must create a real Gateway session through
  `POST /api/v1/sessions`, use the returned Bearer token, and call the owner
  route through Gateway with a request id.
- The positive path must use an observable owner-context assertion, such as
  creating a resource through Gateway and verifying `createdBy` equals the real
  session user.
- The positive path should also send a spoofed inbound `X-User-*` header;
  Gateway must ignore it and inject authenticated context from Auth/session
  cache.
- The smoke must not import Gateway/Auth internals or another service's
  `internal` package. Use HTTP/TCP/database boundaries only.
- Do not print passwords, bearer tokens, session hashes, service tokens, DSNs,
  downstream raw bodies, document text, object keys, or vector payloads.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Smoke gate unset | `SKIP`; ordinary service `go test ./...` remains offline-safe. |
| Required env missing | Fail before network I/O with actionable key names only. |
| Parser/File/Redis/PostgreSQL or owner `/readyz` unavailable | Fail during precheck with the dependency name. |
| Spoofed `X-User-*` headers without Bearer token | Gateway returns `401 unauthorized` with the request id. |
| Gateway session creation fails | Fail without printing credentials or token material. |
| Authenticated owner route returns non-2xx | Fail with status and request id, then inspect Gateway/owner logs by request id. |
| Authenticated route records spoofed owner context | Fail when `createdBy` or an equivalent owner field differs from the real session user. |
| Response envelope malformed | Fail on stable fields such as `data`, `page`, `requestId`, owner fields, or owner-specific IDs. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: a smoke starts the documented local stack, checks owner dependencies,
  rejects a spoofed unauthenticated request, creates a real session, calls the
  public Gateway route with spoofed inbound user headers, and asserts request-id
  propagation plus an observable owner field such as `createdBy`.
- Base: the smoke is documented but skipped locally because a required image or
  seeded credential is unavailable; PR verification records the exact blocker.
- Bad: a smoke directly calls the owner service with `X-User-Id`, trusts a
  caller-supplied auth header, imports Gateway/Auth internals, or requires
  ordinary CI to run the full local Compose stack.

### 6. Tests Required

- Run the targeted smoke with the gate unset and assert it reports `SKIP`.
- When dependencies are available, run the enabled smoke and record the exact
  command.
- Confirm owner dependency prechecks run before the authenticated Gateway route.
- Confirm the spoofed unauthenticated route returns `401`.
- Confirm the authenticated route ignores spoofed `X-User-*` headers by checking
  an owner field such as `createdBy` against the real session user.
- Run the changed service's `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/server` with the
  gate unset.
- Run Compose config parsing when the smoke docs reference local Compose
  startup commands.
- If the route depends on local images, document image build/cache prerequisites
  and record missing-image blockers in PR verification.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```go
func TestOwnerRouteSmoke(t *testing.T) {
    req := newRequest("http://localhost:8083/internal/v1/knowledge-bases")
    req.Header.Set("X-User-Id", "admin")
    callOwnerDirectly(req)
}
```

#### Correct

```go
func TestGatewayKnowledgeOwnerRouteSmoke(t *testing.T) {
    if os.Getenv("GATEWAY_KNOWLEDGE_OWNER_SMOKE") != "1" {
        t.Skip("set GATEWAY_KNOWLEDGE_OWNER_SMOKE=1 to run the smoke")
    }
    assertOwnerDependenciesReady(t)
    assertGatewayRejectsSpoofedHeadersWithoutBearer(t)
    token := createGatewaySession(t)
    assertGatewayKnowledgeBases(t, token)
}
```

## Scenario: Code Scanning Security Boundary Fixes

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: fixing CodeQL or code-scanning findings for command execution, SSRF,
  allocation size, integer conversion, or credential fingerprinting in Go
  services.
- Applies to service-local config loaders, platform clients, repositories,
  credential encryption/fingerprint helpers, and tests that prove the alert is
  closed by a real boundary rather than by suppressing the alert.

### 2. Signatures

- Commands must use `exec.CommandContext(ctx, executable, args...)` with a fixed
  executable string and argument vector.
- Internal AI Gateway callers use service-owned env keys such as
  `AI_GATEWAY_URL` and `DOCUMENT_AI_GATEWAY_URL`.
- Repository pagination/cursor helpers convert to SQL `int32` params only after
  explicit range checks.
- Credential lookup fingerprints use a keyed HMAC helper; compatibility field
  names such as `FingerprintSHA256` may remain when the stored value changes.

### 3. Contracts

- Do not execute user-controlled strings through `/bin/sh -c`, PowerShell
  `-Command`, `cmd /c`, or equivalent shell interpretation.
- Allowlisted stdio or diagnostic commands must reject whitespace,
  control characters, NULs, shell metacharacters, redirects, pipes, expansions,
  and non-allowlisted executable names before process start. LLM-exposed
  diagnostic command tools must be path-free; file reads, writes, and edits must
  go through workspace-bounded file tools instead of path-capable executables.
- MCP stdio is package-test-only. Runtime MCP configuration must reject stdio
  and use Streamable HTTP; package tests that exercise stdio must map validated
  test configuration to an exact code-owned command spec with literal
  executable and argument values. Do not pass configured executable or argv
  values directly into `exec.Command`.
- Internal service URLs must be absolute `http` or `https`, contain no userinfo,
  query, or fragment, and restrict paths to the expected internal endpoint or
  base path.
- Trusted internal hosts are explicit service DNS names documented by the
  caller plus loopback/local development hosts; raw private, link-local,
  multicast, unspecified, or public escape targets are not a safe default.
- Allocation sizes derived from request/provider data must be capped by a
  service-level validated maximum before allocating slices or maps.
- `int` to `int32` conversion must reject negative values and overflow,
  including computed offset overflow; do not silently clamp caller input.
- Fingerprints over provider API keys or similar secrets must use keyed HMAC
  with domain separation, not bare SHA-256 over the secret.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Condition | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Command contains shell syntax or a path-capable executable | Reject before `exec.CommandContext`; no process starts. |
| Runtime MCP configuration uses stdio, or a test stdio command spec is not allowlisted | Return validation/configuration error. |
| Internal URL includes credentials, query, fragment, or wrong path | Reject at config loading and client construction. |
| Internal URL uses raw private/link-local/public host outside the allowlist | Reject as untrusted target. |
| Allocation limit exceeds service maximum | Cap to the validated maximum before allocation or reject the request. |
| Pagination, offset, or cursor is negative/over `math.MaxInt32` | Return a validation error before building SQL params. |
| Credential fingerprint equals bare SHA-256 of the secret | Fail tests; replace with keyed HMAC. |

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: a QA diagnostic tool parses a simple `echo hello` command into an
  allowlisted executable plus args, starts it without a shell, and rejects
  `echo hello; uname -a`.
- Base: `httptest.Server` and loopback AI Gateway URLs remain accepted for
  local tests while credentialed URLs and wrong internal paths fail.
- Bad: a repository casts `(page - 1) * pageSize` to `int32`, a client trusts any
  `http://10.0.0.5/...` URL from env, or a secret fingerprint is
  `hex(sha256(apiKey))`.

### 6. Tests Required

- Add table-driven unit tests for allowed and rejected command values, including
  shell metacharacters, non-allowlisted executables, and non-allowlisted MCP
  command specs.
- Add URL validator tests for malformed, credentialed, wrong-path, public,
  private/link-local, loopback, and explicit service-DNS cases.
- Add integer boundary tests for negative, valid maximum, and overflow values,
  including computed offset overflow.
- Add allocation boundary tests where the effective allocation cap can differ
  from caller/provider supplied counts.
- Add fingerprint tests for determinism with the same key, key separation, and
  non-equality with bare SHA-256.
- Run the changed service's `go test ./...`, required `go build ./cmd/server`,
  and any service-specific additional build such as QA `go build ./cmd/agent`.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

#### Wrong

```go
cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, "/bin/sh", "-c", request.Command)
offset := int32((page - 1) * pageSize)
fingerprint := sha256.Sum256([]byte(apiKey))
```

#### Correct

```go
spec, err := validateCommand(request.Command)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
cmd := exec.CommandContext(ctx, spec.Executable, spec.Args...)

limit, offset, err := paginationInt32(page, pageSize)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

fingerprint := hmacSHA256(fingerprintKey, []byte(apiKey))
```

## Forbidden Patterns

- Root-level Go module used to build all microservices together.
- Cross-service imports from `services/<other-service>/internal/...`.
- HTTP handlers that contain business rules, SQL, runtime doc-engine queries, or MinIO object logic.
- Unbounded goroutines without cancellation.
- HTTP clients without timeouts.
- SQL built by concatenating user input.
- Panics for expected business errors.
- Global mutable state for request-scoped data.
- Logging secrets, tokens, raw credentials, or full sensitive payloads.

---

## Required Patterns

- Pass `context.Context` through request, service, repository, and infrastructure calls.
- Use graceful shutdown for HTTP servers.
- Validate environment configuration at startup.
- Keep service dependencies explicit in constructors.
- Keep business workflows in `internal/service/`.
- Keep persistence in `internal/repository/`.
- Use stable API response shapes: project-owned JSON APIs use
  `{ data, requestId }` / `{ error }`; AI Gateway model invocation success
  responses use OpenAI-compatible shapes as documented in
  `docs/services/ai-gateway/api/internal.openapi.yaml`.
- Add or update tests for changed business logic.

---

## Testing Requirements

Use a risk-based test strategy:

| Change Type | Required Coverage |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Pure functions or validators | Unit tests |
| Service business workflows | Unit tests with mocked repositories/clients |
| Repository SQL changes | Integration tests when database test tooling exists |
| HTTP handlers | Handler tests for status code and response shape |
| Cross-service client changes | Contract-style tests or mocked HTTP server tests |
| Migration changes | Migration validation once tooling exists |

Test naming:

- Use `Test<FunctionOrBehavior>`.
- Prefer table-driven tests for validators, mappers, and policy decisions.
- Test expected errors explicitly with `errors.Is` or `errors.As`.

---

## Configuration Quality

- Read configuration from environment variables in `internal/config` using an
  `envconfig`-style structured loader.
- Validate all required variables at startup.
- Keep defaults safe for local development only.
- Do not read environment variables throughout business logic.
- Document required variables in service README or deployment docs.

---

## Code Review Checklist

Reviewers should check:

- [ ] Does the change stay within the correct service boundary?
- [ ] Are HTTP request and response contracts stable?
- [ ] Are errors classified and returned through the standard error shape?
- [ ] Is sensitive data excluded from logs and responses?
- [ ] Are database changes represented by service-owned migrations?
- [ ] Are Redis/runtime doc-engine/MinIO responsibilities owned by the correct service?
- [ ] Are timeouts and context cancellation handled for external calls?
- [ ] Do tests cover the changed behavior?
- [ ] Can the service still run `go test ./...` and `go build ./cmd/server` independently?

---

## Common Mistakes

- Adding shared code before three services actually need the same behavior.
- Testing only handlers while business rules remain untested.
- Treating Docker Compose startup as a substitute for service-level tests.
- Allowing the gateway to accumulate all business logic.
